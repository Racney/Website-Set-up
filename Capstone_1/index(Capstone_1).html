    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have a deep understanding of OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, VPN technologies (including MPLS and IPSecVPN), and QoS implementation, with extensive hands-on experience in routing and switching in lab environments. </li>
        <li>I have simulated the operation of both small and medium-to-large enterprise networks, mastering OSPF's LSA types and being able to reconstruct the full OSPF topology using three types of LSAs. Regarding MPLS, I am proficient in its label-switching mechanism, MPLS TE (Traffic Engineering) configuration and optimization, and its integration with VPNs to achieve secure and efficient data transmission at an enterprise level. In terms of IPSecVPN, I have an in-depth understanding of its principles and configuration for data encryption, authentication, and integrity protection, applying it effectively to remote access and site-to-site secure communication solutions. 
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, I have conducted thorough experiments with BGP's twelve path selection rules, enabling flexible route manipulation. I also possess practical experience in troubleshooting Layer 2 and Layer 3 loop prevention. Over the next six months, I am committed to preparing for the CCIE lab exam with the goal of obtaining the CCIE certification.
