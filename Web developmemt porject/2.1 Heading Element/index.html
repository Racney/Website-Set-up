<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>This world isn't mess, the reason why you think the world is different than what you think, it's because you never touch the real world, we all thought we can change the world, but why we need to change the world, what is the necessarility? we don't know, and you don't know, you don't want to make this world better, you just want to be a hero, or a main character. but no one should be a leaf for making you to be a main flower.</p>
<p>Just a little bit complain to this world. So naive and so lazy and so stupid</p>
