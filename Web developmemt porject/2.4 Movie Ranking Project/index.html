 <h2>My top 3 movies </h2>

 <h3>1. "The Truman show"</h3>
 <p>I believe most of you watched this movie before. In my opinion, this is a novel topic movie. 
    We can't sure we are not living in a same sitaution like Truman, because we have no idea where we are in the Universe.
    This moive is impressive to me is because the life attitude of Truman, It's extremely positve. When he know he is living in a show, 
    he think this is unbelievable, but he didn't being crushed.
